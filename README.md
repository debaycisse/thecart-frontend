## Introduction 
This project was based on a task during my program at the ALXSWE Software Engineering course.
A team of three learners is to come up with various problems and agree on one, then solve it using technologies of their choice. 
The problem, which this project aims to solve are broadly two problems;
It helps mainly startups extend their customer reach to online customers by showcasing their products to the public beyond the environment where a business is situated. It also increases the customer base of a typical startup as a result. 
It helps individuals by removing the need to visit a business before patronizing its products. It provides a typical buyer with an opportunity to see the details of a product before they go ahead placing an order for it.
